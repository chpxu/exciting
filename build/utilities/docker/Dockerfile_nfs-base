# Base Image for Compiling exciting Using Programs from an NFS Server
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# A docker image with Intel 2021 oneAPI and hpcAPI is too large, hence create
# an image with Debian, nfs server and environment modules set up, in order
# to use HU Physics' installed software (Intel 2019 module).
# This is available via mounting their nfs server
#
# Package Uses
# ------------
# git:                                               Pull from Gitlab
# xsltproc:                                          Preprocess XML into fortran
# nfs-common nfs-kernel-server:                      Mount the NFS server
# libfabric1 & libfabric-dev:                        MPI communication
# wget cmake:                                        Not required
# man tcllib environment-modules:                    TCL module functionality (i.e. module load)
# python2 libpython3.7 libpython3.7-dev python3-pip: Run test suite
#
# Notes
# ---------
# Debian Buster represents development environment of SOL machines in 2021.
#
# Must run apt-get update and apt-get install in the same line, else update
# will get cached by the build.
#
# On Buster, pillow 7.0.0 must be installed prior to excitingtools installing
# it as a dependency. See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/7208

# exciting and test framework requirements
RUN \
apt-get update && \
apt-get install -y build-essential git xsltproc wget cmake nfs-common nfs-kernel-server \
python2 libpython3.7 libpython3.7-dev python3-pip man tcllib environment-modules libfabric1 libfabric-dev

# Test suite python package dependencies

RUN pip3 install --upgrade --force pillow==7.0.0
RUN pip3 install numpy termcolor lxml pytest

# This assumes exciting is present in the same directory as this Dockerfile
COPY exciting /exciting
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]

# This assumes an Intel build
RUN cd exciting && \
cp build/platforms/make.inc.intel build/make.inc && \
