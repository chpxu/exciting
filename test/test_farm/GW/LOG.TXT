Log File GW Testing
-----------------------

In order to test the GW, one needs to initially generate some benchmark data with
the input settings:

```
<groundstate
    do="fromscratch"

<gw
    skipgnd="false"
```

The GW calculation can then be repeated with the settings:

```
<groundstate
    do="skip"

<gw
    skipgnd="false"
```

In order to ensure the result is independent of the choice of threads or MPI processes,
all test executions (following generation of reference data, including `STATE.OUT`) should be run with:

```
mpirun -np <NP> ~/exciting/bin/exciting_mpismp -gw-scf-threads <THREADS>
```

where <THREADS> is equal to the number of threads used by MKL for the
ground state calculation. That it, in order to get QP eigenvalues that are invariant
w.r.t. the choice of threads or MPI processes, the SCF call in the GW must be performed
with the same number of threads as was used by MKL in the ground state calculation.

This is achieved in the GW by temporarily setting MKL threads to <THREADS> while performing
the SCF call. For all other GW execution, the MKL threads will equal whatever is set
via `export MKL_NUM_THREADS`, therefore having a negligible impact on performance.

As such, we:
    a) Store STATE.OUT files
    b) Only test with MKL, as one cannot do the same thread setting in the code with
       openBLAS (see `src/src_gw/gw_scf.F0` for further discussion), and `STATE.OUT`
       is compiler-specific. One could move towards addressing this situation by
       converting `STATE.OUT` to HDF5.
