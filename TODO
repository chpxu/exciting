Infrastructure
---------------
Issue 47 (Alex). Move Lbfgsb.3.0 and LibXC 2.0.0 from src to external. 
 - Observing test breakages on CI with Intel mpismp, but not locally or
   with GCC. Need to improve feedback of the test suite.  

Issue 45 (Alex). Move standalone programs out of src.
 - spacegroup, stateconvert, species, stateinfo.

Issue 14 (Alex). Migrate the build system to CMake.
 - Retain existing external libraries in our repository but move (issue 47).
 - Move standalone programs and decouple from exciting's build system (issue 45).
 - Implement full sub-directory structure in src.
 
Issue 46 (Alex). Incorporate a unit testing framework into exciting.
 - Depends on the completion of issue 14. 


Test Suite
---------------

Issue 48 (Alex/Bene/Hannah). Improve Tolerance of Assertions for INFO.OUT
 - A single tolerance for all floats in a file is restrictive. One should be
   able to specifiy specific tolerances, in addition to a default.
 
Issue 51 (Alex/Bene/Hannah) Review the tolerances of all tests that were migated
from the old test suite.
 - Specifically w.r.t. the hybrid calculations, however all should be reviewed.
