# .gitignore for exciting
#
# Please familiarise yourself with .gitignore patterns before contributing.
# Also consider whether it is better to add patterns to the root gitignore
# or if a local .gitignore is more appropriate.
#
# Basic patterns

#  /target/      folder named target in the top-most directory (leading and trailing /)
#  *.class       every file or folder ending with .class recursively
