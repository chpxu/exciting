Description 
------------------
    exciting is an all-electron full-potential computer package for
    first-principles calculations, based on (linearized) augmented
    planewave + local orbital [(L)APW+lo] methods. This family of
    basis sets is known as the most precise numerical scheme to
    solve the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT),
    reaching up to micro-Hartree precision [1]. 

    exciting features include:
    
      * Ground state DFT with LDA, GGA and hybrid functionals [1, 2].

      * Time-dependent DFT in the linear response regime [3].

      * GW in the G0W0 approximation [4].

      * The Bethe-Salpeter equation for both valence excitations [3] and
        core excitations [5].
