Compiling Exciting
==================

Requirements
------------------

Exciting comes with all the dependencies required to compile the code in serial.
These include:

        FoX XML library for parsing the input
	http://www.uszla.me.uk/FoX/DoX/Licensing.html
	
	BLAS & LAPACK for linear algebra operations 
	http://www.netlib.org/lapack/LICENSE
	
	ARPACK for solving large scale eigenvalue problems
	http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/RiceBSD.txt#LICENSE
	
	LIBXC library of DFT exchange and correlation functionals 
	http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus/wiki/index.php/Libxc

        BSPLINE-FORTRAN: Multidimensional B-Spline Interpolation of Data on a Regular Grid
        https://github.com/jacobwilliams/bspline-fortran

Compilation in parallel requires an MPI library, such as open-mpi, MPICH or Intel MPI library
and optionally, a version of Scalapack.


Compiling
------------------

In order to compile the code, one is required to copy a make.inc file from the examples:

  cp build/platforms/make.inc.ifort build/make.inc
   
which copies the make.inc for Intel. Examples are provided for the Intel and GCC compilers.
The code can then be built by typing:

  make 

in the EXCITING root directory. By default, the serial and mpiandsmp versions of EXCITING
are built, where mpiandsmp refers to a binary with both MPI and openMP parallelism enabled.

Note that if compiling with GCC 10, one should append the F90_OPTS with -fallow-argument-mismatch
See build/make.inc.gfortran and https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html for more details. 

The auxiliary programs include "spacegroup" for producing crystal geometries
from spacegroup data, "species" for generating species files, and "eos" for
fitting equations of state to energy-volume data.

For a full list of build options, one may consult the Makefile in the root directory. 

EXCITING is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. This release may
be used for limited production but please check the consistency of the results
carefully.
